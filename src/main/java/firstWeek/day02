              data types in java
    1- primitive data types
    i) those data types weere created by java , we cant create any primative data types
    ii) primitives data types are 8
    a) byte-short-int-long-float-double/ char-boolean ezberle bunları
        char: is for single characters like A,h ? , * etc.
        boolean: its for true-false values

         byte: its used for the values -128 to 127 ... it if for whole numbers like populatiun or school number
         short: its used for the values from -32000sth to 32000sth ...... it if for whole numbers like population or school number
         int: its used for the values from -2 billion sth to 2 billion sth. its for whole numbers
         long: its used for the values from .... to .... its for whole numbers
         float: its used for decimals. float uses less than memory than double.
                when u create float as data type u have to put 'F' or 'f' at the end
                float has 7 digit at most in decimal part
         doubles: its used for decimals . double is used for scientific researches.
         double has 16 digits at most decimal part.
    2- non-primitive data types
    i) those data types can be created by Java and by Java Develepors
    String is a non-primitive data type
    string data type is used for multiple characters


NOTE:What is the diffrence between "primitive " and "non- pri,itive" data types?
there are 4 main diffrences;
1."primitive" data types start with lower cases, "non-primitive" datta tupes start with upper cases
2"primite" data types can b
